## How this app is built:

This app is built using Swift and UIKit

## How to use the app:

Users can set the game time by clicking either timer and selecting a pre-set time from the pop-up view. Users can also switch turns and start/pause/reset the game. 

## What I Learned 

This was my very first app project and I wanted to start by tackling some basics. 
Here's a checklist of items that I set out to accomplish and made happen:

1. Build the app entirely with UIKit instead of using Storyboards
2. Create custom buttons with CALayer
3. Call and dismiss pop-up views
4. Render stack views
5. Get cozy with constraints and Auto Layout
6. Bring views to life with UIAnimation
7. Better understand how to manipulate color and gradients with CAGradientLayer

Here are a few VERY important items that I learned about along the way:

1. Using enums for state management 
2. Timers and asynchronous state management 
3. Formatting date and time
