## About me:

Hi, my name is Caroline. I'm a self-taught engineer and this is my first app project in process. 
There's alot to learn, so I wanted to start by tackling some basics. 
Here are a few initial items I set out to accomplish:

1. Creating custom buttons 
2. Calling and dismissing pop-up views
3. Rendering stack views
4. Getting cozy with constraints
5. Bringing UI items to life with simple animations 
6. Understanding color and gradients 

Here are a few very important items I've learned about along the way:

1. Using enums for state management 
2. Timers and asynchronous state management 
3. Formatting date and time


## How this app is built:

This app is built using Swift and UIKit

## How to use the app:

Users can set the game time by clicking either timer and selecting a pre-set time from the pop-up view. Users can also switch turns and start/pause/reset the game.
